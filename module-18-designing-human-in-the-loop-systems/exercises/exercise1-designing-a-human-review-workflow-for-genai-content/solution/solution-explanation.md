### Human Oversight Explanation

In this workflow, the AI is used solely to generate an initial content draft based on a brief provided by a content strategist. The draft is never published automatically. Instead, it is routed to an editor who serves as the primary human-in-the-loop decision-maker.

During review, the editor evaluates the AI-generated content for factual accuracy, tone, clarity, and alignment with brand or organizational standards. If the content meets these criteria, the editor approves it for publication, and the approval is logged with reviewer identity, timestamp, and rationale to ensure accountability.

If the editor identifies issues that can be resolved, they may edit the content directly or request a revised version from the AI using specific guidance. When revisions materially change the content, the updated draft is returned to the editor for another review cycle. This prevents unreviewed changes from reaching publication.

Content that contains significant inaccuracies, unsafe language, or inappropriate framing is rejected and blocked from use. In cases where the content presents elevated risk or ambiguity, such as legal, reputational, or policy concerns, the editor escalates the draft to a managing editor for secondary review. The managing editor may approve the content, request further changes, or issue a final rejection.

Human oversight reduces risk by ensuring that generative AI outputs are evaluated within their real-world context, rather than treated as authoritative. Clear decision paths, documented rationale, and escalation mechanisms ensure that responsibility remains with humans and that AI is used as a support tool rather than a final authority.
