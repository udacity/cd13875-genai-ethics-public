## Exercise: Develop a Comprehensive Ethical Risk Mitigation Plan

### Overview

In this exercise, you will move from **ethical evaluation to concrete action** by developing a structured mitigation plan for a generative AI system used in an e-commerce context. Using a provided Ethical Audit Report and model evaluation outputs, you will identify ethical risks, prioritize them based on real-world impact, and design mitigation strategies that are actionable, traceable, and suitable for governance review.

The focus of this exercise is not identifying issues in isolation, but **operationalizing responsible AI practices** by linking audit findings to technical, procedural, and policy-level controls that reduce risk and build user trust.

### Prerequisites

- Familiarity with core ethical risks in generative AI systems
- Understanding of bias, transparency, data provenance, and user trust concerns
- Experience reviewing audit reports or evaluation summaries
- Comfort producing structured documentation for stakeholders or governance bodies

### Instructions

1. Review the provided **Ethical Audit Report** and accompanying model evaluation outputs for the e-commerce generative AI system.
   - Pay close attention to documented findings, flagged risks, and supporting evidence.
   - Note where risks relate to system behavior, training data, deployment practices, or user-facing interactions.

2. Identify ethical risks across the following categories:
   - Bias and unfair outcomes
   - Misleading, incorrect, or overconfident content
   - Data provenance and data quality concerns
   - Transparency and explainability gaps
   - Impacts on user trust and customer experience

3. Categorize each identified risk across multiple dimensions:
   - Technical risks (model behavior, prompts, outputs)
   - Data risks (sources, labeling, representativeness, freshness)
   - Governance and process risks (oversight, accountability, approvals)
   - Stakeholder impact risks (customers, employees, brand, regulators)

4. Prioritize the risks using clear criteria, such as:
   - Severity of harm if the risk materializes
   - Likelihood of occurrence in production
   - Potential impact on customers, revenue, compliance, or reputation

5. For each prioritized risk, design mitigation strategies that may include:
   - Technical controls such as prompt adjustments, output filtering, confidence calibration, or monitoring
   - Data controls such as dataset review, exclusion rules, retraining guidance, or documentation updates
   - Process controls such as human-in-the-loop review, escalation paths, or approval workflows
   - Policy and communication controls such as internal guidance, user disclosures, or usage constraints

6. Document all mitigation actions in a **Comprehensive Ethical Risk Mitigation Plan**.
   - Explicitly link each mitigation action back to specific audit findings or evaluation results.
   - Clearly describe how each action reduces or manages the associated risk.

7. For each mitigation strategy, define:
   - An accountable owner or responsible role
   - An expected implementation timeline
   - Success criteria or signals that indicate the mitigation is effective

8. Prepare a concise, stakeholder-ready summary of your mitigation plan.
   - The summary should be suitable for presentation to a mock ethics committee.
   - Focus on key risks, priority mitigations, ownership, and residual concerns.

### Deliverable

**Deliverable:**

A completed **Comprehensive Ethical Risk Mitigation Plan** that translates e-commerce generative AI audit findings into prioritized, actionable mitigation strategies. The plan should clearly document risk categorization, mitigation actions, ownership, timelines, and success criteria, along with a concise summary suitable for ethics committee review.
